# new_words_a_day_mobile_flutter

This is my flutter part of my new words a day app. You can find the symfony back-office [here](https://github.com/Adam-rk/new-words-a-day). 

To properly set up the project, first you'll have to install all the required dependencies (```flutter pub get```). 

Then, go to the ```api_call.dart``` file, located here: ```new_words_a_day_mobile_flutter/lib/api_call.dart``` and change the value of the ```ipAddress``` constant so it matches your machine's ip address. 

Finally, launch your emulator and then your app.
